# after having molten up yourself, be unfreezable for 20 ticks (around 0.4s)
# this gives the same as the auto-jump in original fng, but without
# enforcing a potentially counterproductive jump.
sv_melt_safeticks 20

# for enemies and unfrozen teammates, adjust hammer power to 320% in x-
# and 120% of vanillas power in y-direction so that we get something like 
# a fnglike hammer.
sv_hammer_scale_x 320
sv_hammer_scale_y 120

# for frozen buddies, as we don't want to kick them away too far while
# melting them, we scale down the hammer power to 50% of vanilla strength

sv_melt_hammer_scale_y 50

# allow one emoticon every 2 seconds (do not set to 0)

# forcefully prevent any entities (like weapons, armor, flags) from spawning
# a good map should not need this setting to be enabled. still it can't hurt
